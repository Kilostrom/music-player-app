# music-player-app

This is just a simple music player app that use the files in your personal Music folder. It will only in take files that end with '.mp3'

# what I learned

- how to use the pygame libraries along with os library

- formating the window display how I want it to look like, what it should show as text by rendering it in text

- interaction between the keyboards button with the application. ( space = pause/unpause, arrow key left and right = previous or next song)
